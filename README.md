# What is "fun_with_go"

About a year and a half ago I taught myself Python as the initial step in discovering the world of web development. Since then I've deployed several apps on Google App Engine. In that time, and in several place, I've stumbled across the Go language. I've been wanting to learn more programming stuffs, so this is my attempt to teach myself Go by going back to square 1 and attempting to build a simple webapp. 

Hopefully this can be useful to others who are also starting out with Go.
